abstract = {Hyperspectral reflectance factor image estimations were performed in the 400--700 nm wavelength range using a portable consumer-level laptop display as an adjustable light source for a trichromatic camera. Targets of interest were ColorChecker Classic samples, Munsell Matte samples, geometrically challenging tempera icon paintings from the turn of the 20th century, and human hands. Measurements and simulations were performed using Nikon D80 RGB camera and Dell Vostro 2520 laptop screen as a light source. Estimations were performed without spectral characteristics of the devices and by emphasizing simplicity for training sets and estimation model optimization. Spectral and color error images are shown for the estimations using line-scanned hyperspectral images as the ground truth. Estimations were performed using kernel-based regression models via a first-degree inhomogeneous polynomial kernel and a Mat\&\#x00E9;rn kernel, where in the latter case the median heuristic approach for model optimization and link function for bounded estimation were evaluated. Results suggest modest requirements for a training set and show that all estimation models have markedly improved accuracy with respect to the DE00 color distance (up to 99\% for paintings and hands) and the Pearson distance (up to 98\% for paintings and 99\% for hands) from a weak training set (Digital ColorChecker SG) case when small representative training data were used in the estimation.},

abstract = {Estimating spectral reflectance has attracted extensive research efforts in color science and machine learning, motivated through a wide range of applications. In many practical situations, prior knowledge is available that ought to be used. Here, we have developed a general Bayesian method that allows the incorporation of prior knowledge from previous monochromator and spectrophotometer measurements. The approach yields analytical expressions for fast and efficient estimation of spectral reflectance. In addition to point estimates, probability distributions are also obtained, which completely characterize the uncertainty associated with the reconstructed spectrum. We demonstrate that, through the incorporation of prior knowledge, our approach yields improved reconstruction results compared with methods that resort to training data only. Our method is particularly useful when the spectral reflectance to be recovered resides beyond the scope of the training data.},

We analyze the problem of estimating high-dimensional spectral signals from low-dimensional device responses. We begin with the theory and geometry of linear estimation methods. These methods use linear models to characterize the likely input signals and reduce the number of estimation parameters. Next, we introduce two submanifold estimation methods. These methods are based on the observation that for many data sets the deviation between the signal and the linear estimate is systematic; the methods incorporate knowledge of these systematic deviations to improve upon linear estimation methods. We describe the geometric intuition of these methods and evaluate the submanifold method on hyperspectral image data.},

abstract = {The problem of estimating spectral reflectances from the responses of a digital camera has received considerable attention recently. This problem can be cast as a regularized regression problem or as a statistical inversion problem. We discuss some previously suggested estimation methods based on critically undersampled RGB measurements and describe some relations between them. We concentrate mainly on those models that are using a priori information in the form of high-resolution measurements. We use the ``kernel machine'' framework in our evaluations and concentrate on the use of multiple illuminations and on the investigation of the performance of global and locally adapted estimation methods. We also introduce a nonlinear transformation of reflectance values to ensure that the estimated reflection spectra fulfill physically motivated boundary conditions. The reported experimental results are derived from measured and simulated camera responses from the Munsell Matte, NCS, and Pantone data sets.},

abstract = {For digital cameras, device-dependent pixel values describe the camera's response to the incoming spectrum of light. We convert device-dependent RGB values to device- and illuminant-independent reflectance spectra. Simple regularization methods with widely used polynomial modeling provide an efficient approach for this conversion. We also introduce a more general framework for spectral estimation: regularized least-squares regression in reproducing kernel Hilbert spaces (RKHS). Obtained results show that the regularization framework provides an efficient approach for enhancing the generalization properties of the models.},

abstract = {Abstract In photorealistic image synthesis the radiative transfer equation is often not solved by simulating every wavelength of light, but instead by computing tristimulus transport, for instance using sRGB primaries as a basis. This choice is convenient, because input texture data is usually stored in RGB colour spaces. However, there are problems with this approach which are often overlooked or ignored. By comparing to spectral reference renderings, we show how rendering in tristimulus colour spaces introduces colour shifts in indirect light, violation of energy conservation, and unexpected behaviour in participating media. Furthermore, we introduce a fast method to compute spectra from almost any given XYZ input colour. It creates spectra that match the input colour precisely. Additionally, like in natural reflectance spectra, their energy is smoothly distributed over wide wavelength bands. This method is both useful to upsample RGB input data when spectral transport is used and as an intermediate step for corrected tristimulus-based transport. Finally, we show how energy conservation can be enforced in RGB by mapping colours to valid reflectances.}
