
In Figure 7 of the supplemental information of Meng et. al. \cite{Meng2015} is a full page
of spectral estimates for the Macbeth ColorChecker.
% These reflectances are included in \textbf{colorSpec} as kindly provided by Pascale \cite{Pascale}.
Figure 13 is an imitation of their Figure 7
(although the 24 original reflectances seem to be a little different).
